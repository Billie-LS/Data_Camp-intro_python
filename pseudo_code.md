1. Define a user-defined function for calculating the area of a rectangle.
   - Input: length, width
   - Output: area

2. Define a user-defined function for calculating the area of a triangle.
   - Input: base, height
   - Output: area

3. Define a user-defined function for calculating the area of a circle.
   - Input: radius
   - Output: area

4. Display a menu to the user to choose a shape (rectangle, triangle, or circle).

5. Get the user's choice of shape.

6. If the user chose a rectangle:
   - Prompt for the length and width.
   - Call the rectangle area function with the provided values.
   - Print the calculated area.

7. If the user chose a triangle:
   - Prompt for the base and height.
   - Call the triangle area function with the provided values.
   - Print the calculated area.

8. If the user chose a circle:
   - Prompt for the radius.
   - Call the circle area function with the provided radius.
   - Print the calculated area.

9. Ask the user if they want to calculate the area for another shape.
   - If yes, repeat from step 4.
   - If no, exit the program.

This pseudocode outlines the basic structure of a Python script for calculating and printing the area of basic shapes using user-defined functions. The actual Python code would implement these steps and include input validation and error handling as needed.
