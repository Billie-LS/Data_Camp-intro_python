## Scenario

This project is designed to calculate the area of different geometric shapes, specifically rectangles, triangles, and circles. Users can select the shape they want to calculate the area for, input the required dimensions, and receive the area as the output.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly script for calculating the areas of common geometric shapes. By offering a menu-driven interface, users can easily choose the shape they want to calculate and input the necessary parameters.

## Product

A Python script that includes the following features:

- Calculation of the area of a rectangle based on user-provided length and width.
- Calculation of the area of a triangle based on user-provided base and height.
- Calculation of the area of a circle based on the user-provided radius.
- A menu interface for selecting the desired shape.
- The ability to perform multiple area calculations in a single run, allowing the user to continue or exit when they are done.

## Technologies

### Hardware Used for Development

The project was developed on the following hardware:

- **MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)**
  - Chip: Apple M1 Max
  - Operating System: macOS Venture version 13.0.1

### Development Software

The project was developed using the following software:

- **Python**
  - Python Platform: macOS-13.0.1-arm64-arm-64bit
  - Python version: 3.9.15 packaged by conda-forge (as of Nov 22, 2022)
  - Additional Python Libraries:
    - pip 22.3
- **Homebrew**
  - Homebrew version: 3.6.11
